This project are require to conduct an inference statistical analysis that cover the following analysis based on dataset https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hongsean/korea-income-and-welfare.

## Data

Original data : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hongsean/korea-income-and-welfare.

Clean data : Download through repository file (Korea-Income-Clean.xlsx)

## Hypothesis Testing (Two Sample)

Variables: Income and Gender.

We will test whether the mean of
income of male is different than the mean of income of female at 95% confidence level,
assuming unequal variances.

## Correlation Test

Variables: Income and Family Members

We observe the strength of relationships between the two variables above by using Pearson product moment orrelation.

## Regression Test 

Independent value= Year born
Dependent value = income

We want to predict the value of income based on the year born.

#Chi Square Goodness of Fit Test

Variable : Educational Level

We want to observe wether the proportion of each educational level is different or same

## Chi Square Independent Test

Variables: Marriage and Educational Level

We want to test whether the educational level and marriage is independent or not.

## ANOVA (Analysis of Variance)

Variables: Region and Income

We want to test wether the different part of regions have same mean of income.
